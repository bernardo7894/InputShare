__InputShare__ enables you to share the keyboard and mouse of your computer with an Android device via ADB in wired / wireless way.

## About this fork

This fork keeps the original InputShare workflow, but adds a few quality-of-life changes aimed at wireless debugging and multi-monitor desktop use:

- Remembers the full wireless debugging address, including the port, so reconnecting does not lose addresses like `192.168.1.84:45678`.
- Attempts to reconnect to the saved wireless device automatically on launch.
- Lets you choose which monitor shows the fullscreen overlay.
- Adds an option to keep the real desktop cursor contained on the overlay monitor while showing a frozen copy of your actual cursor at its original desktop position.
- Improves terminal shutdown so `Ctrl+C` can cleanly stop the app.
- Adds an optional Android keep-awake helper APK for devices where ADB wake/stay-awake commands are not enough. This was added after testing on a Xiaomi Poco F7 / HyperOS device.

For the keep-awake helper, enable **Keep Screen On** in settings. InputShare will try to install/start `server/InputShareKeepAwake.apk` through ADB. Some Xiaomi/HyperOS devices block ADB installation; if that happens, install the APK manually and grant **Display over other apps** to `InputShare Keep Awake`.

## Features

- __Seamless Switching__: Quickly switch keyboard and mouse input between the PC and Android device via hotkey and edge toggling.
- __Wired / Wireless Connection__: Supports both wired and wireless connections for flexible input sharing.
- __Wide Compatibility__: Compatible with various Android devices, not a specific brand.
- __Clipboard Sync__: Seamlessly sync clipboard content between your computer and Android device.
- __Easy-to-Use GUI__

## Thanks

InputShare is based on [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) project and provided a GUI with the build-in ADB invocation.

Thanks to [@yxyh357](https://github.com/yxyh357), who improved the performance of InputShare under high polling-rate.
